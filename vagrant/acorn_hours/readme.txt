Acorn Hours is the first part of a project to build a community service tracking application where students can select
community service events, log their hours, and have them approved. 

This part of the project only lists the community service events. Large parts of this code where modeled off the 
Udacity oauth cource. 

A button in the project was taken from here: https://www.formstack.com/blog/2010/customize-form-buttons-with-css/.
